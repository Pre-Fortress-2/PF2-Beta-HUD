# PF2-Beta-HUD-FIXES2023
These are my fixes to the old 0.6 CSS HUD, reminder I am not an expert on this and there are still a few visual bugs left and two "Gameplay" changing bugs like the Spy Disguise Status not showing the Class icon and the Armor icon not turning Red once damaged enough.
Another bug found: After overhealing someone as a Medic, HP Numbers turn Yellow on the TargetID, making it unreadable.

Wont work on this hud until I choose to do it, someone else can try to fix these bugs but im done with it.
