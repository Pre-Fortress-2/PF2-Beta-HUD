# PF2-Beta-HUD-FIXES2023
These are my "fixes" to the old 0.6 CSS HUD, reminder I don't have much knowledge on HUD editing and there are still a few visual bugs left i'll list down below.

## List of known bugs

- TargetID Health value changes from White to Yellow, making the text unreadable.
- Spy Disguise Status (HUD on the bottom left) doesn't show up when Disguised, may be related to Class Icons being disabled for other parts of the HUD.
- Armor icon doesn't turn red once nearing a low value, may be related to the hudanimations_tf.txt
- Color inconsistencies in various elements and panels
- Vote HUD hasn't been fixed, too lazy.
- MOTD Screen text panel stretches out and leaves the Main panel area, too lazy to fix.

Apologies for releasing this in such a broken state, I just want to work on something else, anyone is free to edit this hud or fix it of course. Sorry!
